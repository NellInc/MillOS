## Summary

MillOS workers are persistent agent entities with multi-dimensional internal state: mood, energy, focus, personality traits, social relationships, and thought bubbles. Worker state is managed by three Zustand stores (`workerPersonalityStore`, `workerMoodStore`, `workerDialogueStore`) and rendered through a component hierarchy in `src/components/workers/`. The system operationalizes MillOS's AI welfare thesis by making worker internal states visible and player-affecting.

## Internal State Model (`src/types/workerPersonality.ts`)

Each worker carries a `WorkerInternalState` struct:

| Field                  | Type                                                         | Description                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mood`                 | `'content' \| 'focused' \| 'stressed' \| 'tired' \| 'alert'` | Core emotional state                                                |
| `moodIntensity`        | number 0-1                                                   | How strongly the mood is expressed                                  |
| `energy`               | number 0-1                                                   | Affects animation speed and posture                                 |
| `focus`                | `FocusType`                                                  | Current attention target (task/colleague/machine/break/concern)     |
| `recentInteractions`   | string[]                                                     | Recently interacted worker IDs                                      |
| `relationshipStrength` | Map<string, number>                                          | Per-worker 0-1 relationship scores                                  |
| `traits`               | PersonalityTrait[]                                           | Persistent personality (diligent/social/cautious/efficient/curious) |
| `currentThought`       | string?                                                      | Text for thought bubble                                             |
| `thoughtExpiry`        | number?                                                      | Timestamp after which thought clears                                |

(workerPersonality.ts:22-44)

## Mood Color Coding

Moods map to additive-blend colors for the visual aura system (`MoodAura.tsx`):

| Mood     | Color              | Semantic             |
| -------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| content  | `#10b981` (green)  | Calm, satisfied      |
| focused  | `#3b82f6` (blue)   | Concentrated         |
| stressed | `#f59e0b` (amber)  | Pressured            |
| tired    | `#8b5cf6` (purple) | Low energy           |
| alert    | `#ef4444` (red)    | Heightened awareness |

(workerPersonality.ts:50-56)

## Personality Traits

Five traits assigned from a random pool at worker initialization (default 2 traits per worker):

- **diligent** (CheckCircle icon): focused task completion
- **social** (Users icon): high interaction drive
- **cautious** (Shield icon): risk-averse decision-making
- **efficient** (Zap icon): optimization-oriented
- **curious** (Eye icon): exploration-oriented

(workerPersonality.ts:13, 61-67; workerPersonalityStore.ts:35-36)

Initialization adds slight energy variation (`0.7 + Math.random() * 0.3`) so no two workers start identically. (workerPersonalityStore.ts:49-52)

## Worker Personality Store (`src/stores/workerPersonalityStore.ts`)

Zustand store managing all worker internal states via a `Map<string, WorkerInternalState>`. Key actions:

| Action              | Signature                          | Notes                                |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `initializeWorker`  | `(workerId, traits?)`              | Idempotent — skips if already exists |
| `updateMood`        | `(workerId, mood, intensity?)`     | Default intensity 0.7                |
| `updateEnergy`      | `(workerId, delta)`                | Clamps to [0, 1]                     |
| `setFocus`          | `(workerId, focus, targetId?)`     | Tracks what worker is attending to   |
| `recordInteraction` | `(worker1Id, worker2Id)`           | Adds to recentInteractions           |
| `setThought`        | `(workerId, thought, durationMs?)` | Sets bubble with optional auto-clear |

(workerPersonalityStore.ts:17-32)

## Worker Mood Store (`src/stores/workerMoodStore.ts`)

Separate store from personality — mood simulation recalculations (which are expensive) don't trigger personality visual updates and vice versa. The architectural separation allows `PersonalityAnimationManager.tsx` to subscribe only to personality state, while mood-dependent components subscribe only to mood state.

## Worker Dialogue System

`src/utils/workerDialogue.ts` generates contextual dialogue for workers. `src/stores/workerDialogueStore.ts` manages dialogue state and queuing. `src/utils/workerPortraits.ts` provides portrait utilities for dialogue display.

Test coverage: `src/utils/__tests__/workerDialogue.test.ts` and `src/stores/__tests__/workerMoodStore.test.ts` exist. (find results)

## Visual Components

Worker rendering components in `src/components/workers/`:

| Component                         | Purpose                                        |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `DetailedWorker.tsx`              | Full-detail worker at close camera distances   |
| `SimplifiedWorker.tsx`            | LOD-reduced worker at distance                 |
| `WorkerHair.tsx`                  | Procedural hair geometry                       |
| `MoodAura.tsx`                    | Colored light sphere driven by mood state      |
| `FocusIndicator.tsx`              | Shows what worker is attending to              |
| `PersonalityAnimationManager.tsx` | Coordinates personality-driven animation state |
| `SharedWorkerGeometries.ts`       | Shared geometry buffers for performance        |
| `WorkerPersonalityLayer.tsx`      | Mood aura and optional focus-indicator host    |

## Relationship to AI Welfare Thesis

The worker system is not purely decorative. Mood, focus, dialogue, preferences,
requests, and safety-reporting behavior can become visible through the worker
layer and operational panels. BAS governance affects the simulation and
flourishing state even though the retired per-worker autonomy ring is no longer
rendered.

The `FocusType: concern` state is significant — when workers are in `concern` focus, they are processing something that troubles them. This is the closest MillOS comes to representing AI distress as a gameplay-visible state.
